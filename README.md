# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Christina's TODOs
Must do: 
Minesweeper instructions

Improvements to existing apps: 
Internet browser should have frequently-visited or bookmarked sites including LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter. 
About section that lists how it's made (context menu when you click on the lemon icon)

New apps:
Contacts app open to my entry. Can also have nonsensical ones. Could be a good way to represent a resume
Or resume could be in a word-like app
Messenger (Apple style or vintage style?) - with cheeky messages about why I'd be a great hire - maybe a chatbot 
Terminal
Calculator
Timer / clock app 
Weather app
